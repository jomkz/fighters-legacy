# 3D Model Authoring Guide

This guide covers the engine conventions for glTF 2.0 aircraft and unit meshes. Follow it
to ensure your models are accepted by `validate-mesh` and render correctly at runtime.

---

## Overview

The engine loads `.glb` (binary glTF) and `.gltf` (JSON + separate `.bin`) files as raw bytes
via `FolderContentPack`. The renderer parses glTF 2.0 at load time. All conventions below
exist so the renderer can locate expected nodes and textures without heuristics.

Mesh files live in `aircraft/<id>/` inside the content pack directory.

---

## Coordinate system and winding

The engine uses a **right-handed, Y-up, metric** coordinate system — the glTF 2.0 standard —
with one engine-specific convention: **+X is forward** (the aircraft nose, matching the flight
model's longitudinal axis).

| Axis | Direction |
|---|---|
| **+X** | Forward (nose) |
| **+Y** | Up |
| **+Z** | Starboard (right); −Z = port (left) |

Blender's glTF exporter writes Y-up by default (its *+Y Up* option), so no manual up-axis
rotation is needed. For forward: the exporter maps Blender **+X → glTF +X**, so model your
aircraft with the **nose pointing along Blender +X** and it lands on the engine's +X-forward
axis. (The exporter has no "forward axis" dropdown — orientation is whatever you build in
Blender.) Verify against the reference mesh below.

**Winding and normals.** Triangles must be wound **counter-clockwise when viewed from outside**
(the glTF 2.0 convention), so face normals point **outward**. Blender produces this by default.
This matters because the engine's opaque pipeline is **single-sided** — back faces are culled. A
mesh with inverted winding renders *inside-out*: from outside it shows only its far interior
faces (or vanishes), and the model's own body becomes visible from the cockpit camera, which sits
at the entity origin and relies on back-face culling to stay hidden.

**Verify in Blender.** Enable **Viewport Overlays → Face Orientation**. Correctly wound (outward)
faces render **blue**; inverted faces render **red**. A finished exterior should be entirely blue.
If you see red, recalculate normals in Edit Mode: **Mesh → Normals → Recalculate Outside**
(`Shift+N`).

**Verify with the pipeline.** `validate-mesh` checks triangle winding against the stored vertex
normals and reports a mesh that is wound inside-out (most faces wound opposite their normals) as an
error, with the same "Recalculate Outside" hint. Run it on your exported `.glb` before shipping.

### Reference mesh

The engine's built-in placeholder (a tetrahedron — +X forward, outward normals) is the canonical
reference for this convention. Export it and import into Blender (File → Import → glTF 2.0) to
compare orientation and winding against your own model:

```bash
python3 tools/gen_builtin_glb.py --export-dir /tmp/builtin
# writes /tmp/builtin/builtin_entity.glb  (+X-forward tetrahedron, all-blue from outside)
#        /tmp/builtin/builtin_floor.glb   (Y-up ground quad)
```

---

## Toolchain

Blender is the recommended authoring tool.

**Export settings** (File → Export → glTF 2.0):

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Format | **glTF Binary (.glb)** for release; glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin) acceptable for development |
| Include | Selected Objects, UVs, Normals, Tangents |
| Vertex Colors | **Off** — engine does not use them |
| Textures | **Do not embed** — export as separate PNG files and run through `tex-compress` |
| Compression | Off (engine handles this separately via KTX2) |
| Animation | Include if gear/prop/door animations are present |

See [`docs/modding/textures.md`](textures.md) for the PNG → KTX2 texture pipeline.

---

## Node naming conventions

*(Enforced by `validate-mesh`)*

- All node names must be **lowercase with underscores** — no spaces, no uppercase, no hyphens
- The root node name must match the asset ID exactly

```
fa18c              ← root node; matches asset ID
fa18c_fuselage
fa18c_canopy
fa18c_left_wing
fa18c_right_wing
fa18c_left_flap
```

Invalid names that will fail validation: `FA18C`, `fa-18c`, `FA-18C Fuselage`, `Fuselage`.

---

## Damage-state meshes (`_b` suffix)

*(Enforced by `validate-mesh`)*

A battle-damaged variant of node `X` is named `X_b`. Both the base node and its `_b` variant
must coexist in the same `.glb` file. The engine selects between them at runtime based on the
entity's damage threshold.

```
fa18c_fuselage      ← clean
fa18c_fuselage_b    ← battle-damaged
fa18c_left_wing
fa18c_left_wing_b
```

Not every node requires a `_b` variant. Structural nodes (fuselage, wings) benefit most;
small details (cockpit glass, antennas, sensor pods) may omit it without a validation error.
The absence of a `_b` pair produces a warning, not an error.

---

## LOD variants

*(Auto-discovered and validated by `validate-mesh`)*

LOD files are separate `.glb` files with a `_lod<N>` suffix. The base file (no suffix) is the
highest-detail model used in the cockpit view.

| File | Usage | Polygon target |
|---|---|---|
| `fa18c.glb` | In-cockpit and close-pass view | Full detail |
| `fa18c_lod0.glb` | Formation distance (~500–2000 m) | ~50% of base |
| `fa18c_lod1.glb` | Long range (~2000–8000 m) | ~20% of base |
| `fa18c_lod2.glb` | Horizon / large formation | ~5% of base |

LOD files must pass the same conventions as the base file: same node naming convention, same
material structure, no embedded textures. When you run `validate-mesh fa18c.glb`, the tool
automatically discovers and validates `fa18c_lod0.glb`, `fa18c_lod1.glb`, etc. in the same
directory.

LOD files are optional. A model without LOD variants is valid; the engine uses the base mesh
at all distances until LOD files are provided.

---

## Special-purpose meshes

These follow naming conventions but are not validated by `validate-mesh`. They are expected
by the renderer when present.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<id>_shadow.glb` | Simplified convex hull used for shadow casting. No materials required. |
| `<id>_cockpit.glb` | Cockpit interior. Must include a node named `camera_anchor` (the pilot eye-point) and the instrument panel geometry. Instruments are non-interactive geometry. |

---

## Material requirements

*(Enforced by `validate-mesh`)*

- All materials must use **PBR metallic-roughness** (`pbrMetallicRoughness` in the glTF JSON)
- No embedded image data — all textures must be external URI references pointing to `.ktx2` files
- Material names must follow the same lowercase-underscore convention as node names
- Opaque materials are rendered **single-sided** (back faces culled), so winding/normals must be
  correct — see [Coordinate system and winding](#coordinate-system-and-winding). Use a
  `KHR_materials` alpha-blend material only for genuinely double-sided surfaces (canopy glass).

Known glTF extensions (`KHR_materials_unlit`, `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`, etc.) produce
a validation **warning** — the renderer may or may not support them. Unknown extensions produce
a validation **error**.

---

## Texture references

All material textures must reference external `.ktx2` files, not embedded PNG data. In Blender,
export textures to separate files then process them with `tex-compress` before referencing them
in the glTF material. The URI in the glTF JSON should be a relative path to the `.ktx2` file:

```json
"baseColorTexture": {
    "index": 0
},
...
"images": [
    { "uri": "../textures/fa18c_diffuse.ktx2" }
]
```

See [`docs/modding/textures.md`](textures.md) for the full texture pipeline workflow.

---

## Animation conventions

Animation names are not validated, but the renderer expects these specific names when present:

| Animation name | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `gear_extend` | Landing gear extending |
| `gear_retract` | Landing gear retracting |
| `prop_spin` | Propeller rotation (turboprops/pistons) |
| `bay_open` | Weapon bay opening |
| `bay_close` | Weapon bay closing |
| `sweep` | Wing sweep (variable-geometry aircraft) |

---

## File size

A `.glb` that exceeds 50 MB is almost certainly embedding texture data rather than referencing
external `.ktx2` files. `validate-mesh` warns on files above this threshold. Aircraft models
without embedded textures are typically 1–15 MB.

---

## Validation

Run `validate-mesh <file.glb>` before committing. The tool automatically discovers and
validates LOD sibling files in the same directory. All errors are reported in a single pass.

Exit codes: 0 = valid, 1 = validation failure, 2 = bad arguments.

[`docs/modding/formats.md`](formats.md).

---

## Procedural placeholder generation

`tools/blender_gen.py` generates a parametric fighter aircraft `.glb` set using
Blender's headless Python API. It is intended for development placeholders and
modding examples, not as a substitute for hand-authored art.

**Requirements:** Blender 4.0 or later.

### Invocation

```bash
# Linux
blender --background --python tools/blender_gen.py -- \
    --id fa18c --output-dir assets/aircraft/fa18c/

# macOS
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender --background \
    --python tools/blender_gen.py -- \
    --id fa18c --output-dir assets/aircraft/fa18c/

# Windows (PowerShell)
& "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.x\blender.exe" --background `
    --python tools\blender_gen.py -- `
    --id fa18c --output-dir assets\aircraft\fa18c\
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--id <name>` | — | Asset ID (required). Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. |
| `--output-dir <path>` | — | Directory to write output files (required). |
| `--wing-style delta\|swept\|straight` | `swept` | Wing planform: swept (generic 3rd-gen), delta (Mirage/F-16 style), straight (subsonic). |
| `--length <m>` | `15.0` | Fuselage length in metres. |
| `--lod` | off | Also export `_lod0`, `_lod1`, `_lod2` variants at reduced resolution. |
| `--bake-textures` | off | Bake a diffuse PNG and generate a solid-colour ORM PNG via Cycles CPU. |
| `--tex-size <px>` | `1024` | Bake resolution (power-of-two). |
| `--seed <n>` | `42` | RNG seed for the damage-state hull breach pattern. |

### Output files

For `--id fa18c --output-dir assets/aircraft/fa18c/ --bake-textures --lod`:

```
assets/aircraft/fa18c/
    fa18c.glb           clean mesh + fa18c_b damage node; .ktx2 URIs pre-wired
    fa18c_dmg.glb       SceneRenderer damageMeshName target
    fa18c_lod0.glb      ~50 % vertex reduction
    fa18c_lod1.glb      ~25 %
    fa18c_lod2.glb      ~10 %
    fa18c_diffuse.png   baked diffuse → tex-compress --type diffuse
    fa18c_orm.png       ORM (R=AO, G=roughness, B=metallic) → tex-compress --type orm
    fa18c_dmg_diffuse.png
    fa18c_dmg_orm.png
```

All `.glb` files pass `validate-mesh` immediately. The `.ktx2` URIs are pre-wired
in the material JSON so that the engine loads them once `tex-compress` has been
run — no manual glTF editing required.

Normal maps are not generated because the engine's built-in flat tangent-space
default (`{128, 128, 255}`) is sufficient for placeholder meshes.

### Texture pipeline after generation

```bash
tex-compress --type diffuse assets/aircraft/fa18c/fa18c_diffuse.png
tex-compress --type orm     assets/aircraft/fa18c/fa18c_orm.png
tex-compress --type diffuse assets/aircraft/fa18c/fa18c_dmg_diffuse.png
tex-compress --type orm     assets/aircraft/fa18c/fa18c_dmg_orm.png
```

See [`docs/modding/textures.md`](textures.md) for the full texture pipeline.
