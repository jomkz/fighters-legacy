# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

### Linux — Fedora (primary maintainer platform)

```bash
sudo dnf install cmake ninja-build gcc g++ clang clang-tools-extra \
  vulkan-devel SDL3-devel openal-soft-devel lcov \
  libasan libubsan glslang vulkan-validation-layers
```

`libasan` and `libubsan` are required for the `asan` build preset (`-fsanitize=address,undefined`). They are separate packages from `gcc` on Fedora.

`glslang` provides `glslangValidator`, the GLSL-to-SPIR-V compiler used to build the Vulkan renderer shaders at CMake configure time.

`vulkan-validation-layers` provides `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation`, enabled automatically in debug builds via `FL_VK_VALIDATION`. Without it the renderer still works but validation errors go unreported.

For Bluetooth gamepad support (Xbox controllers), see [docs/linux-gamepad.md](linux-gamepad.md).

> **Note (OpenAL):** Some Fedora installs ship `/etc/openal/alsoft.conf` with `drivers = null`, which silently discards all audio. If `audio_test` reports success but you hear nothing, override it: `printf '[general]\ndrivers = pipewire\n' > ~/.config/alsoft.conf`

### Linux — Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build gcc g++ clang clang-format \
  libvulkan-dev libsdl3-dev libopenal-dev lcov glslang-tools \
  vulkan-validationlayers
```

`glslang-tools` provides `glslangValidator` for Vulkan shader compilation. `vulkan-validationlayers` provides `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` for debug builds.

> **Note:** SDL3 and OpenAL Soft may need building from source on older distros if the packaged versions are below the required minimum. Check `cmake/dependencies.cmake` (added in Phase 1) for version requirements.

### Windows (MSVC 2022)

1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload
2. Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (1.3 or later) — includes `glslangValidator`, `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation`, and MoltenVK support headers
3. Optional: install Ninja via `winget install Ninja-build.Ninja` (faster incremental builds)

### macOS (Apple Silicon, 13+)

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja vulkan-headers molten-vk vulkan-loader glslang
```

`molten-vk` provides the Vulkan-over-Metal ICD; `vulkan-loader` provides `libvulkan.dylib`; `glslang` provides `glslangValidator`. Validation layers are not available via Homebrew — install the [LunarG Vulkan SDK for macOS](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) to get `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation`.

> **Note:** CI uses the Homebrew path (no validation layers). For local dev, the LunarG SDK is recommended so validation errors are caught before CI.

### Optional tools

**REUSE** — checks SPDX license compliance. CI enforces this automatically via `fsfe/reuse-action`; install locally for fast feedback before pushing:

```bash
pip install reuse
```

Run with `reuse lint` from the repo root.

Copyright is declared centrally in `REUSE.toml` rather than in each file. All `.h` and `.cpp` files are covered by a glob annotation there — new source files do not need an in-file `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` line. The `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` line in each source file is still required (see `CLAUDE.md`).

---

## Building

All platforms use CMake presets — no raw flag strings needed.

```bash
# Linux / macOS
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug

# Windows (PowerShell)
cmake --preset debug-msvc
cmake --build --preset debug-msvc
```

### Running tests

```bash
ctest --preset debug --output-on-failure          # Linux / macOS
ctest --preset debug-msvc --output-on-failure     # Windows
```

### Available presets

| Preset | Platform | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `debug` | Linux / macOS | Development (Werror ON) |
| `release` | Linux / macOS | Packaging |
| `debug-msvc` | Windows | Development (Werror ON) |
| `release-msvc` | Windows | Packaging |
| `coverage` | Linux / macOS | Coverage reporting (Werror OFF) |
| `asan` | Linux / macOS | AddressSanitizer + UBSan |

CI uses `debug` (Linux/macOS) and `debug-msvc` (Windows). The `coverage` and `asan` presets have their own dedicated CI jobs.

### Local preset overrides

Create a `CMakeUserPresets.json` in the repo root to override preset defaults locally (e.g. a different binary directory or a custom toolchain path). This file is gitignored.

---

## Testing

For running the test suite see [Building → Running tests](#running-tests).

### Code coverage

CI enforces the following gates on every push and pull request:

| Scope | Metric | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `engine/` | Branch coverage | ≥ 80% (CI enforced) |
| `engine/` | Line coverage | ≥ 70% (CI enforced) |

`platform/` backends, `tools/`, and `game/` are excluded from coverage reporting. Branch
coverage catches untested conditional paths and is the primary gate; line coverage is a
secondary floor. `platform/` is excluded because platform divergence makes unit testing
brittle. `game/` is excluded in Phase 1 — the binary is a stub with no game loop; its
coverage gate will be added when Phase 2 game logic lands.

Gates use `--exclude-throw-branches` (gcovr 8.x): GCC instruments every non-`noexcept`
call site with an "exception throw" branch that is never taken in normal unit tests.
Excluding these focuses the gate on meaningful decision branches (if/else, switch).

An HTML coverage report is uploaded as a CI artifact on every run (retained 30 days).
Access it from **Actions** → select a run → **Artifacts → coverage-report**.

**Running coverage locally (Linux/macOS — requires GCC or Clang):**

```bash
cmake --preset coverage
cmake --build --preset coverage
ctest --preset coverage --output-on-failure

# Capture and filter (engine/ only, with branch data; game/ excluded until Phase 2)
lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.raw \
     --branch-coverage --ignore-errors empty,source,gcov,negative
lcov --remove coverage.raw '/usr/*' '*/tests/*' '*/vendor/*' '*/_deps/*' \
     '*/platform/*' '*/tools/*' '*/game/*' \
     --output-file coverage.info \
     --branch-coverage --ignore-errors empty,unused,source,gcov

# Check gates (requires: pip install gcovr)
gcovr --filter 'engine/' --exclude-throw-branches --fail-under-branch 80 --print-summary
gcovr --filter 'engine/' --exclude-throw-branches --fail-under-line 70 --print-summary

# Generate HTML report
genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage-report --branch-coverage
# Open coverage-report/index.html
```

Codecov also posts a PR coverage delta comment automatically.

---

## Git setup

### DCO sign-off

This project requires a `Signed-off-by` line on every commit (Developer Certificate of Origin). Always use `git commit -s` or install the commit-msg hook to have it appended automatically:

```bash
cp scripts/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

The hook appends `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email>` if the line is not already present, so you never accidentally trigger a DCO failure.

### clang-format (pre-commit)

CI enforces clang-format on every changed C/C++ file. Install the pre-commit hook to auto-format staged files before each commit so the check never fails in CI:

```bash
cp scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

To install both hooks at once:

```bash
cp scripts/hooks/commit-msg scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## IDE setup

### VS Code

Open the repo root. VS Code auto-detects `CMakePresets.json` and populates the configure dropdown via the CMake Tools extension. Recommended extensions and workspace settings are committed in `.vscode/extensions.json` and `.vscode/settings.json` — VS Code prompts to install them on first open.

### CLion

CLion reads `CMakePresets.json` natively since 2022.3. File → Open → select the repo root. CLion loads all configure/build/test presets automatically.

### Visual Studio 2022

File → Open → CMake → select `CMakeLists.txt`. Visual Studio reads `CMakePresets.json` and shows all presets in the configuration dropdown.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CMake | 3.25+ | System / installer |
| Vulkan SDK | 1.3+ | LunarG |
| MoltenVK | bundled with Vulkan SDK | LunarG (macOS) |
| SDL3 | latest | FetchContent or system |
| OpenAL Soft | 1.24+ | FetchContent or system |
| ENet | 2.x | FetchContent |
| Catch2 | 3.x | FetchContent |
| tomlplusplus | 3.4+ | FetchContent or system |

FetchContent fallback is used when the system package is absent or below the required version. The CMake configuration prints the source (system vs fetched) for each dependency.

---

## CI vs local platform

CI runs on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest`. The maintainer's primary dev platform is Fedora — this is intentional. Both are Linux x86-64 with GCC/Clang; using different distros catches platform-specific assumptions (e.g. library paths, default compiler versions) earlier than a perfectly matched environment would.

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the full three-platform matrix.

---

## Release workflow

Releases are tagged with `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The `release.yml` workflow triggers on version tags, builds all three platforms, generates release notes via git-cliff, and creates a GitHub Release with SLSA build provenance.

**Requires `git-cliff`:** `cargo install git-cliff` | `dnf install git-cliff` | `brew install git-cliff`

### Step 1 — Create the release PR

From a clean `main`:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
./scripts/cut-release.sh v0.1.0
```

This creates a `release/v0.1.0` branch, generates `CHANGELOG.md`, commits, and pushes.
Open the printed PR URL, wait for CI, and merge.

### Step 2 — Tag and trigger the release

After the PR merges:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
./scripts/tag-release.sh v0.1.0
```

This tags `main` and pushes the tag. The `release.yml` workflow fires immediately.

---

## fl-server

`fl-server` is the headless dedicated server binary. It implements the ENet
UDP transport backend and runs without a window, renderer, audio, or input.

### Prerequisites

No system install needed — ENet is fetched automatically via FetchContent.
All other prerequisites are the same as the base debug build (CMake 3.25+,
a C++20-capable compiler, and the standard project deps from the sections above).

### Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug --target fl-server
# Binary: build/debug/tools/fl-server
```

### Run

```bash
# Defaults: port 4778, 16 peers
./build/debug/tools/fl-server

# Override port and peer count via positional args
./build/debug/tools/fl-server 4778 4

# Flags
./build/debug/tools/fl-server --help
./build/debug/tools/fl-server --version
```

### Configuration

`fl-server` resolves settings in three tiers (later tiers override earlier ones):

1. `server.toml` in the working directory (or path in `FL_CONFIG`). Written
   with commented defaults on first run if absent. Absent or unreadable config
   is not fatal — the server logs a warning and uses defaults.
2. CLI positional args: `fl-server [port] [maxPeers]`
3. Environment variables (highest precedence — recommended for containers):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FL_PORT` | `4778` | UDP bind port |
| `FL_MAX_PEERS` | `16` | Maximum simultaneous connected peers |
| `FL_CONFIG` | `./server.toml` | Path to config file |

### Kubernetes / containers

- Pass all config via environment variables; no volume mount required.
- Optionally mount a pre-baked `server.toml` via ConfigMap — the first-run
  write is skipped when the file already exists.
- All output goes to stdout; compatible with Fluentd, Loki, and similar
  log aggregators.
- Responds to `SIGTERM` (sent by Kubernetes on pod termination) with a 100 ms
  graceful peer disconnect before exit — well within the default
  `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` of 30 s.

### Stop

`Ctrl-C` or `SIGTERM` triggers a graceful disconnect and exits 0.

---

## fl-client

`fl-client` is a headless developer test tool for smoke-testing the full
client/server lifecycle locally. It connects to a running `fl-server`, sends
periodic ping packets, then disconnects cleanly.

### Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug --target fl-client
# Binary: build/debug/tools/fl-client
```

### Usage

```bash
fl-client [host] [port] [--count N] [--interval MS]
```

| Argument | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` | Server hostname or IP |
| `port` | `4778` | Server port |
| `--count N` / `-n N` | unlimited | Send N packets then disconnect |
| `--interval MS` | `1000` | Milliseconds between pings |

Environment variables `FL_HOST` and `FL_PORT` set the defaults when the
positional args are omitted.

### End-to-end smoke test

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start server
./build/debug/tools/fl-server 4778 4

# Terminal 2 — send 5 pings at 500 ms intervals, then exit
./build/debug/tools/fl-client 127.0.0.1 4778 --count 5 --interval 500
```

Expected server output: `peer 0 connected` → `peer 0 disconnected`.
Expected client output: `connecting` → `connected` → pings → `disconnecting`.

---

## locale-extract

`locale-extract` is a developer tool that keeps source key references and
`locale/en/*.toml` files in sync. It is also the CI gate for locale drift.

### Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug --target locale-extract
# Binary: build/debug/tools/locale-extract
```

### Usage

```bash
locale-extract [--src <dir>] [--locale <dir>] [--gen-keys <output>] [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--src <dir>` | `engine/` | Directory tree to scan for `.get()`/`.format()`/`.getPlural()` calls |
| `--locale <dir>` | `locale` | Root locale directory containing `en/` |
| `--dry-run` | off | Report new/orphaned keys without modifying any files |
| `--gen-keys <output>` | — | Write `generated/i18n/LocaleKeys.h` with `constexpr` key constants |

### Lint mode (default)

Scans `--src` for key references, compares them against `locale/en/*.toml`,
and prints a `+`/`-` diff of new and orphaned keys. Exits 1 if any drift is
found; exits 0 if all keys are in sync.

```bash
# Check for drift without modifying files
./build/debug/tools/locale-extract --src engine --locale locale --dry-run

# Inject missing keys into locale/en/*.toml (preserves comments)
./build/debug/tools/locale-extract --src engine --locale locale
```

New keys are injected with `= ""` so translators can fill them in. Existing
content — including `# translator context comments` — is never rewritten.

This lint also runs as the `locale_lint` CTest and as the
`.github/workflows/locale-lint.yml` CI job on every push and PR.

### Key constants (optional)

```bash
# Generate LocaleKeys.h (compiler catches key typos)
cmake --build --preset debug --target locale-keys
# Header at: build/debug/generated/i18n/LocaleKeys.h
```

```cpp
// Usage in engine code:
#include "generated/i18n/LocaleKeys.h"
loc.get(keys::engine::content::pack_init_failed);
```

See [docs/modding/localization.md](modding/localization.md) for the full
translator workflow and mod locale directory layout.

## fighters-legacy

`fighters-legacy` is the game client binary. In Phase 1 it is a stub that exercises the crash
reporting, logging, and mod loading systems without a playable game loop. The full game loop,
HUD, and menus land in Phase 2.

### Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug --target fighters-legacy
# Binary: build/debug/game/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy
```

### Run

```bash
# Default startup (Info log level)
./build/debug/game/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy

# Override log level for this session only (does not persist to user.toml)
./build/debug/game/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy --log-level debug

# Print version and exit
./build/debug/game/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy --version
```

### User data directory

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/jomkz/fighters-legacy/` |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/jomkz/fighters-legacy/` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\jomkz\fighters-legacy\` |

Session logs are written to `<userdata>/logs/engine_<date>.log` (10 retained).
Crash dumps are written to `<userdata>/logs/crash_<timestamp>.log` (5 retained).

---

## Roadmap status

To report phase completion against target dates:

```bash
./scripts/roadmap-status.sh
```

Queries the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/jomkz/projects/2) via `gh` and prints a per-phase progress table showing % done, % of time elapsed, and an on-track/at-risk/behind/overdue signal. Requires `gh` (authenticated) and GNU `date`.
