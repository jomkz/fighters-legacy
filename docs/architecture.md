# Architecture Overview

fighters-legacy is a general-purpose combat flight sim engine. The engine is fully **content-agnostic** — it has no knowledge of any specific game, franchise, or asset format. All game content enters the engine through a single boundary: the `IContentPack` interface.

### Platform HAL (`platform/`)

Thin abstraction over OS and hardware APIs. Each backend is isolated:

| Module | Backend | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer | Vulkan 1.3 + MoltenVK | `platform/vulkan/` |
| Windowing / Input | SDL3 | `platform/sdl3/` |
| Audio | OpenAL Soft | `platform/openal/` |
| Networking | ENet | `platform/net/` |

The HAL exposes platform-independent interfaces to the engine core. Nothing above the HAL layer links directly against Vulkan, SDL3, OpenAL, or ENet headers.

For upstream documentation on each backend, see [`docs/references.md`](references.md).

#### Platform HAL Interfaces

All interfaces live under `platform/` and are exposed via the `platform-hal` CMake INTERFACE library. Engine core and backends link against `platform-hal` rather than including headers by path. All platform HAL types (`IRenderer`, `ILogger`, `IInput`, `Key`, `HudElement`, etc.) are in `namespace fl`.

| Interface | Header | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IWindowEventHandler` | `platform/IWindowEventHandler.h` | Callback target for window events (resize, close); implemented by the engine game loop |
| `IWindow` | `platform/IWindow.h` | Create/destroy OS window, pump events, query dimensions, expose native handle for surface creation; fullscreen toggle (`setFullscreen`), window resize (`setSize(w, h)`), display mode selection (`setDisplayMode`), title update (`setTitle`), current monitor query (`getCurrentMonitorId`). `width()`/`height()` return physical framebuffer pixels (GPU/swapchain resolution; ≥2× logical size on Retina/HiDPI); `logicalWidth()`/`logicalHeight()` return DPI-independent window size matching SDL pointer-event coordinates |
| `IDisplay` | `platform/IDisplay.h` | Monitor enumeration, fullscreen display mode listing, per-monitor refresh rate query (used by renderer for vsync decisions) |
| `ICursor` | `platform/ICursor.h` | OS cursor shape control: standard shapes (`Arrow`, `Hand`, `Crosshair`, `ResizeNS`, `ResizeEW`, `ResizeAll`, `Text`, `None`) and custom RGBA bitmap cursors |
| `IRenderer` | `platform/IRenderer.h` | Render frame lifecycle: init, beginFrame, endFrame, shutdown; `setOverlayLines` for debug text overlay; `submitOverlayElements(span<HudElement>)` for 2D game overlay elements (cockpit HUD, rain, notices — accumulated per frame, cleared by endFrame); `setConsoleElements(span<HudElement>)` for the game console overlay (non-owning span, cleared by endFrame) |
| `IAudio` | `platform/IAudio.h` | Buffer upload, source play/stop/position/velocity, listener transform/velocity, source-relative (non-positional) mode |
| `ITextInputHandler` | `platform/IInput.h` | Callback target for OS text input and IME composition events; implemented by any UI component that accepts free-form text |
| `IInput` | `platform/IInput.h` | Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad state (SDL3 GameController API); haptic feedback (`rumble`, `rumbleTriggers`, `stopRumble`, `supportsRumble`, `supportsTriggerRumble`); drives text input mode via `ITextInputHandler` |
| `IJoystickEventHandler` | `platform/IJoystick.h` | Callback target for joystick hot-plug (add/remove); implemented by any system that tracks HOTAS devices |
| `IJoystick` | `platform/IJoystick.h` | Raw joystick/HOTAS input: arbitrary axis count, hat switches, button state, device name + GUID for binding persistence; hot-plug events via `IJoystickEventHandler` |
| `INetworkEventHandler` | `platform/INetwork.h` | Callback target for network events (connect, disconnect, receive); implemented by the multiplayer subsystem |
| `INetwork` | `platform/INetwork.h` | UDP transport: bind/connect, send/recv, peer state, frame pump |
| `IFilesystem` | `platform/IFilesystem.h` | Synchronous file I/O and directory scan over two path domains (Assets, UserData) |
| `IAsyncFilesystemHandler` | `platform/IAsyncFilesystem.h` | Callback target for async read completions; implemented by the terrain streaming subsystem |
| `IAsyncFilesystem` | `platform/IAsyncFilesystem.h` | Non-blocking whole-file reads for per-frame terrain chunk streaming; completions dispatched via `service()` |
| `ILogger` | `platform/ILogger.h` | Structured logging routed to the platform-native output |

**Event handler pattern:** `IWindowEventHandler`, `INetworkEventHandler`, `ITextInputHandler`, `IAsyncFilesystemHandler`, and `IJoystickEventHandler` are separate interfaces registered with their respective `IWindow` / `INetwork` / `IInput` / `IAsyncFilesystem` / `IJoystick` instances. The engine implements the handler; the platform backend calls it during `pollEvents()` / `service()` / text input events / async I/O completions / hot-plug events. This keeps platform-to-engine callbacks decoupled without requiring the backend to know anything about the game loop.

**Wiring — `Platform` struct:** `platform/Platform.h` defines a plain aggregate struct holding `std::unique_ptr` to each interface. The platform entry point (e.g. `platform/sdl3/`) constructs a `Platform`, populates it with concrete backend instances, and passes it to the engine on startup. The engine holds `Platform` by value and owns all interface lifetimes. Backends can be mixed freely — a test build might use a null renderer stub alongside a real filesystem backend.

**Design rules for all HAL interfaces:**
- No platform-specific headers (`SDL3`, `vulkan.h`, `al.h`, `enet.h`) may appear in any interface file.
- `IWindow::nativeHandle()` returns `void*` — the only platform type that crosses the boundary, and it does so as an opaque pointer used only by the Vulkan backend internally.
- All interface methods are pure virtual. No implementation code lives in these headers.
- Interfaces that can fail during init expose `getLastError() const → const char*` for human-readable diagnostics.
- **Thread safety:** `ILogger::log` is the only HAL method guaranteed thread-safe. All other methods on all other interfaces must be called from the main thread.
- **`IAsyncFilesystem` threading note:** The background worker thread is an internal implementation detail of the SDL3 backend. All `IAsyncFilesystem` methods — including `service()`, `readFileAsync()`, and `cancelRead()` — must be called from the main thread. Completion data passed to `onReadComplete()` is valid only for the duration of the callback; callers must copy any bytes they need before returning.
- **`IJoystick::flush()` note:** Must be called once per frame alongside `IInput::flush()`, after all input has been read for that frame. Devices recognised as standard gamepads are owned exclusively by `IInput` (SDL_Gamepad); `IJoystick` (SDL_Joystick) handles only raw HOTAS devices that are not standard gamepads.

**`IRenderer` scope:** `IRenderer` provides retained GPU resource management (`createMesh`, `createTexture`, `createMaterial`, `destroy*`), per-frame scene submission (`setScene(FrameScene)`), and renderer settings (`applySettings(RendererSettings)`). The Vulkan backend (`VkRenderer`) runs, per frame: a particle compute dispatch, then shadow → opaque forward (PBR + CSM; writes HDR + a world-space normal G-buffer) → GTAO compute → sky → transparent → bloom → tonemap (which composites bloom + ambient occlusion and applies FXAA). The opaque/terrain path also does altitude/slope biome blending and, at Atmospheric sky quality, analytic aerial perspective. `RendererSettings` (defined in `RenderTypes.h`) carries vsync mode, AA mode (`Off`/`FXAA`/`TAA` — MSAA was removed in favour of TAA), bloom, draw distance, shadow quality, particle density, ambient-occlusion quality, sky quality, and auto-exposure — populated from `GraphicsSettings` in `main.cpp` so that `platform/` headers remain free of `engine/` dependencies. See `CLAUDE.md` for the detailed pass-by-pass render graph.

**`IFilesystem` is synchronous:** `readFile` blocks until the OS delivers the data. It is correct for startup asset loading, mod discovery, and config reads. It must not be called on the main thread for per-frame terrain streaming. See `IAsyncFilesystem` for async terrain streaming reads.

### Engine Core (`engine/`)

Game logic and simulation, independent of any specific content:

- **Game loop** (`engine/loop/`) — `TimeController` (fixed-timestep accumulator, time compression), `GameLoop` (sim thread, frame gating, render alpha). `ISimUpdate` is the callback interface for game systems advancing each tick. `GameLoop::enqueueSimCallback()` allows any thread to queue a one-shot lambda that runs at the top of the next sim tick — used by the game console to dispatch entity mutations safely.
- **Entity system** — component-based scene graph
- **Flight model** — aerodynamics simulation
- **AI runtime** — C++ autopilot controllers (`engine/ai/`) and Lua-scripted AI behaviours
- **Mission loader** — scenario and campaign structure
- **Localization** — keyed string lookup with BCP 47 fallback chain, `{placeholder}` interpolation, plural forms, and RTL metadata; see `engine/i18n/`

### Content System (`engine/content/`)

Bridges the engine core to external content:

- **`IContentPack`** — the single interface all content packs must implement. Exposes asset loading, mission data, configuration, and security metadata (`getTrustLevel`, `isNativePlugin`). The engine calls only this interface; it never knows what implements it.
- **`AssetManager`** — caches and serves assets via active content packs. Runs `AssetValidator` on every returned asset (magic-byte checks + size limits) before caching; discards and logs any asset that fails.
- **`ModLoader`** — discovers directory mods and compiled plugins at runtime. Validates `id`/`name` manifest fields against path-traversal, Windows reserved names, and length limits. Parses optional `[mod.trust]` section into `TrustLevel`. Detects native plugin binaries and fires `IContentPackEventHandler` callbacks. Loads plugins with `RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_NOW` (POSIX) or full-path `LoadLibrary` (Windows) to prevent DLL planting.
- **`LuaSandbox`** (`engine/script/`) — sandboxed Lua 5.5 execution environment for AI and mission scripts. Deny-lists `io`, `os`, `package`, `debug`, `dofile`, `loadfile`; replaces `require` with a custom loader restricted to the pack's own `ai/` directory. Rejects precompiled bytecode. RAII destructor calls `lua_close()`.

Mods can ship translations by placing TOML files under `locale/<lang>/` inside their mod directory. The `Localization` system merges these with the engine's base `locale/` files; higher-priority mods win on key conflicts. See [docs/modding/localization.md](modding/localization.md).

### Content Packs (external)

Any repository that implements `IContentPack` and compiles to a shared library can be loaded as a content pack. The engine is indifferent to the source or format of the underlying assets.

## Locked Architectural Decisions

These decisions are finalized and not subject to revision without an RFC — or, during primary
development (pre-`kProtocolVersion` freeze), a dated **decision record** (see below). The
2026-06-28 re-target to 128+ multiplayer revised several rows via that lightweight path.

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Rendering | Vulkan + MoltenVK (primary); OpenGL 4.1 Core (Phase 3, Linux + Windows only) | MoltenVK → Metal on Apple Silicon. macOS uses Vulkan/MoltenVK exclusively — OpenGL is deprecated on macOS 14+ and is not a supported renderer path on Apple platforms. |
| GPU math | GLM (MIT) | INTERFACE dep on `platform-hal`; available everywhere without Vulkan |
| GPU memory | VulkanMemoryAllocator (MIT) | VMA v3.3.0; device-local staging for meshes/textures |
| Texture runtime | KTX-Software / Basis Universal | Apache-2.0; transcode at load → BC7 desktop, ASTC Apple Silicon |
| World coordinate convention | Right-handed Y-up meters (glTF-native) | No axis conversion needed; Vulkan Y-flip handled in projection matrix |
| Depth convention | Reverse-Z (near=1 far→0, compare=GREATER, D32_SFLOAT) | Better floating-point precision distribution across scene depth |
| Windowing / input | SDL3 | Wayland + modern controller support; long-term path |
| Audio | OpenAL Soft | Positional 3D audio; native music in OGG; no MIDI dependency in engine core |
| Network transport | Under replacement for 128+ (Epic L) — likely GameNetworkingSockets (BSD-3); `enet6` v6.1.3 today | enet6 was sized for ~32 peers; the per-peer host loop is unproven at 128 @ 60 Hz. Replacement is selected via a scale-spike and lands behind the `INetwork` HAL, so engine/game code is backend-agnostic. enet6 may remain a LAN/low-count option. (Revised by the 2026-06-28 decision record.) |
| Build system | CMake 3.25+ | Cross-platform from day one |
| Engine repo | `fighters-legacy` (this repo) | Separate from fighters-toolkit |
| Content system | Plugin / content-pack architecture | Each content source = one plugin; mods = other plugins; engine core has zero content dependency |
| Native 3D models | glTF 2.0 | Royalty-free; Blender export; industry standard |
| Native textures | PNG (source) + KTX2/DDS (GPU) | Mipmaps, BC compression; toolchain converts PNG → KTX2 at pack time |
| Native audio | OGG Vorbis / Opus | Open, compressed, widely supported |
| Native flight model | TOML | Human-readable, structured, easily diffable |
| Native missions | YAML | Human-readable, tool-friendly |
| Native campaigns | YAML | Arbitrary theater graph; no FA 6-theater limit |
| Native terrain | Streaming heightmap chunks + JSON | No tile-count cap; supports large theaters |
| Native AI scripts | Lua 5.5 | Embeddable, sandbox-able, moddable |
| Multiplayer topology | `fl-server` dedicated binary + `fl-lobby` REST service | Server-authoritative; no P2P player-count cap; self-hostable |
| Multiplayer scale target | **128+ simultaneous players** (32 = near-term acceptance floor) | Drives the scaling seams below; see [docs/design.md](design.md) "Multiplayer at Scale". (Revised by the 2026-06-28 decision record.) |
| Server simulation | Data-parallel **job system** over a single authoritative tick + a graceful **overrun governor** | Parallelizes per-entity integration + AI **and per-peer snapshot assembly** (workers build buffers, the sim thread flushes) so 128 players + AI + projectiles hold 60 Hz; when the tick still exceeds budget the `TickGovernor` sheds work (snapshot cadence/budget + AI-sample decimation) rather than spiralling, with the `GameLoop` catch-up cap as the bounded backstop. Spatial sharding deferred as a later option |
| Wire state encoding | **Quantized / bit-packed** snapshot stream (#515 ✓) + 3D interest culling (#402 ✓) + per-client priority/budget scheduling (#516 ✓) + adaptive per-client send-rate / congestion response (#518 ✓) | Quantized codec landed: frame-origin-relative positions, smallest-three quaternion, quantized vel/omega — replaced the fixed 64/88-byte records (see [docs/snapshot-quantization.md](snapshot-quantization.md)). Priority/budget scheduling (relevance-ranked per-client byte budget + hybrid despawn/retention) keeps per-client bandwidth bounded as population grows. A per-peer AIMD `CongestionController` then sheds bandwidth on degraded links by decimating the snapshot send rate and scaling the byte budget, driven by ENet loss/RTT — see [docs/congestion-control-design.md](congestion-control-design.md) |
| Player identity / auth | **Server-side, pluggable `IIdentityProvider`** (offline-verifiable signed tokens) | Persistent stats/ranking/bans key on a verified account, not a spoofable client GUID; self-hostable, no first-party hosted infra |
| Persistence | **`IPersistence` storage HAL** (SQLite single-server, Postgres for clusters) | Accounts, stats, bans, persistent-world state; promotes file-based banlists into a store |
| Cluster orchestration / live services | **Go** (k8s/OpenShift operator, Agones-native; `fl-account`, `fl-review`) | Intentional polyglot boundary: C++ engine/game/server, Go infrastructure; idiomatic for the k8s ecosystem |
| Single-player topology | `fl-server` running locally (`bind_address=127.0.0.1`, `max_peers=1`) | One simulation path; no bifurcated codebase; single-player is multiplayer with one peer |
| LAN server discovery | Raw UDP broadcast + IPv6 link-local multicast (#91) | `DiscoveryBeacon` (fl-server) + `DiscoveryListener` (game client) in `engine/net/`; separate socket outside ENet; client server browser in issue #143 |
| Weather and time of day | Server-authoritative `WeatherController` in `engine/weather/` | Autonomous cycle (Clear→PartlyCloudy→Overcast→Rain→Storm); `Snow` and `Blizzard` are operator-set presets that do not participate in the autonomous cycle; 10× time-scale default, wind/gust/turbulence model; synced via `MsgWeatherState` (0x04) at ~6 Hz |
| Entity system | Dynamic pool, no hard caps | No fixed object count limit |
| License | GPL v3 | Engine modifications must stay open source; protects community investment |
| Hosting | GitHub, public repository | Unlimited Actions CI on public repos; GitHub Free sufficient |
| Async file I/O backend | Worker thread + `std::mutex` queue (`SDL3AsyncFilesystem`) | `SDL_AsyncIO` deferred; consistent cross-platform behaviour without conditional compilation in the interface |

### Decision Records

During primary development (before the `kProtocolVersion` freeze) a locked decision may be
revised by a dated decision record instead of a full RFC, provided the change is recorded here
with its rationale. This keeps the velocity of pre-1.0 architecture work without leaving the
locked table silently stale.

**2026-06-28 — Re-target to 128+ multiplayer.** A roadmap gap-analysis against the bar of a
modern combat flight sim supporting 128+ simultaneous players found the architecture sized for
~32. The following decisions were revised (rows above updated accordingly):

- Multiplayer scale target **32+ → 128+** (32 becomes the near-term acceptance floor).
- Multiplayer is now a **co-equal product pillar** (PvP + co-op PvE + persistent world), not a
  secondary extension to single-player.
- New seams added as locked decisions: data-parallel **server job system**, **quantized wire
  state** + priority/budget scheduling, **server-side identity/auth**, **persistence HAL**, and
  a **Go** cluster operator + live-services tier (polyglot boundary).
- **Network transport** (`enet6`) reversed: under replacement for the 128-peer target
  (GameNetworkingSockets lean) behind the `INetwork` HAL.
- **Hosting model:** self-host only — the project ships the identity/live-services software but
  runs no central infrastructure; communities self-host. (No first-party PII/GDPR liability.)

These land across a new **Phase 5 — Multiplayer at Scale & Live Services** and scaling seams in
Phases 3–4; see [docs/roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

**2026-06-28 — Server job system: data-parallel tick, not spatial sharding (Epic A, #510).** The
8-core Release reference-env characterisation (#505) showed `WorldBroadcaster::onTick` is the 128+
ceiling — CPU-bound on the single-threaded per-entity sim + per-peer snapshot build, not on
`enet6`. The chosen approach parallelises the per-entity work *within a single authoritative tick*
across a worker pool (`engine-job`), rather than sharding the world into multiple authoritative
regions. Rationale: per-entity work is already embarrassingly parallel (each entity owns its
`FlightIntegrator`; the `SpatialIndex` + controllers are read-only mid-tick), and one tick keeps a
single consistent world with no cross-shard hand-off or snapshot stitching. Both the per-entity
integration + AI passes (#511) **and the per-peer snapshot assembly** (#512) run data-parallel over
the same worker pool — for snapshots, workers build per-peer buffers (each peer's interest query +
scheduler + encode is `peerId`-isolated) and the sim thread flushes (`m_net.send` stays
sim-thread-owned). Spatial sharding is the deferred next scaling axis. Full design in
[docs/server-job-system-design.md](server-job-system-design.md).

**2026-06-29 — Quantized snapshot encoding + 3D interest (Epic B, #515/#402).** The reference-env
characterisation (#505) measured ~480 KB/s/client downstream at 128 idle clients — 3.2× the
≤150 KB/s gate — driven by the fixed 64/88-byte per-entity snapshot records. The per-tick entity
body is now a quantized, bit-packed record stream (position relative to a per-snapshot `double`
frame origin, smallest-three quaternion, quantized velocity/omega; full-vs-delta per-record `full`
bit), and the per-peer interest query gained an exact 3D (XYZ) distance gate. Encoding-only and
transport-agnostic (stays on `enet6`), so it proceeds independently of the transport replacement
(Epic L). The priority/budget scheduler (#516) and client-acked baselines (#517) build on this codec;
congestion response (#518) follows. Full design in
[docs/snapshot-quantization.md](snapshot-quantization.md).

**2026-06-29 — Priority/budget snapshot scheduler (Epic B, #516).** The quantized codec (#515) cut the
per-record cost but the server still sent *every* visible entity every tick, so aggregate bandwidth
still grew O(visible) per client. Each peer now gets a per-tick byte budget (`[world]
snapshot_budget_bytes`, default 1200, 0 = unlimited); the pure `engine/net/SnapshotScheduler` ranks
the visible set by relevance (distance, closing-speed, recency, player-owned) and sends only the
highest-priority records that fit, deferring the rest. A recency term guarantees eventual inclusion of
every visible entity (no starvation) and the peer's own entity is always sent (client-side prediction
needs it). Because budgeting omits entities from some snapshots, this also adds a **hybrid despawn
model**: the client retains entity state across snapshots and evicts only on an explicit
`SnapshotDespawn` TLV (a confirmed sim removal) or after a retention timeout (interest-out / lost
despawn); the server force-sends a full record on re-entry past that window so a returning entity stays
decodable. Wire-additive (new TLV tag only, `kProtocolVersion` unchanged); the bandwidth win is
measured by `bot_swarm`'s `downstream_kbs_per_client`. Adaptive send-rate/congestion (#518) builds
on this.

**2026-06-29 — Client-acked delta baselines (Epic B, #517).** The fixed `[world]
baseline_interval_ticks` re-sync cleared every peer's known-entity set on the same global tick,
re-sending *all* visible entities as full records at once — a synchronized cross-peer bandwidth spike
— and left a dropped full record undecodable for up to that interval (~2 s). The server now drives
full-vs-delta off what each client has actually acknowledged: clients already echo the last snapshot
tick they processed in `MsgClientInput`/`MsgHeartbeat`, and the server treats that `tickIndex` as the
snapshot **ack** (clamped to the present, kept as a monotonic high-water mark). An entity is re-sent
as a full record every tick until the peer acks the tick its full streak started on, then converges
to deltas; a scheduler deferral restarts the streak so an ack of a tick on which the entity was
withheld cannot falsely confirm it. Recovery is now ~1 RTT and per-entity rather than a periodic
all-entity spike, with **no wire-format change** — the client additionally ignores out-of-order
snapshots so its echoed tick stays monotonic. The per-entity `kSnapshotRetentionTicks` force-full
(interest-out re-entry) is retained as an ack-independent backstop, and the `m_peerKnownGens` map is
now pruned on that same window (the periodic baseline clear used to bound it). `baseline_interval_ticks`
and `WorldBroadcaster::setBaselineInterval` are removed.

## Content Pack Architecture

This is the central design decision that affects every other phase. **The engine core has no dependency on any content library.** All asset access goes through an `IContentPack` interface.

### Mods vs Plugins

Content for Fighters Legacy comes in two forms.

**Mods (Lua + assets)** are directories dropped into `mods/<name>/` containing a `manifest.toml` plus any combination of Lua AI scripts, glTF meshes, TOML flight model and weapon data, YAML missions and campaigns, OGG audio, and PNG / KTX2 textures. **Most user content — reskins, missions, new aircraft, custom campaigns — is a mod.** No C++ compiler required.

**Plugins (compiled content packs)** are shared libraries (`.dll` / `.so` / `.dylib`) that implement the `IContentPack` interface. GPL v3 applies to compiled plugins unless a linking exception is granted. **Install compiled plugins only from authors whose source you can verify.**

### IContentPack Interface

```
engine/content/IContentPack.h
    name(), version(), priority()
    init()              → Status { Ready | NeedsConfiguration }
    configure(IWindow*) → bool
    hasAsset(name, AssetType) → bool
    loadMesh(name)        → MeshData
    loadTexture(name)     → TextureData
    loadAudio(name)       → AudioBuffer
    loadFlightModel(name) → FlightModel
    loadMission(name)     → MissionData
    loadTerrain(name)     → TerrainData
    loadAIScript(name)    → AIScript
    listAssets(AssetType) → vector<string>
    getTrustLevel()       → TrustLevel { Unsigned | Community | Maintainer }
    isNativePlugin()      → bool
```

### Mod Loader

```
engine/content/ModLoader.cpp
    scanModsDirectory("mods/")
    loadManifest("mods/<name>/manifest.toml")
    buildContentStack()   — sorted by priority; higher-priority packs override lower
    resolveAsset(name, type) — walk stack until found
```

### Mod Manifest Format (TOML)

```toml
[mod]
name        = "Example Content Pack"
id          = "example-content"
version     = "1.0.0"
engine-api  = "1.0"
priority    = 100
depends     = []

[mod.trust]          # optional — absent means Unsigned
signed-by = "community"   # "community" | "maintainer"; GPG verification is Phase 6
signature = "..."         # parsed and logged but not cryptographically verified until Phase 6
```

### Content Pack Layout on Disk

```
mods/
    example-content/          ← compiled content pack (ships as shared library)
        manifest.toml
        example-content.dll/.so
    fl-base-pack/             ← bundled default content (Phase 2+, fighters-legacy/fl-base-pack)
        manifest.toml
        aircraft/
        missions/
        terrain/
        audio/
    my-reskin-mod/            ← user mod example
        manifest.toml
        aircraft/f22/
            F22.png
```

**TOML vs YAML:** TOML is used for definition and configuration data (flight models, weapon specs, unit data, mod manifests, HUD layouts, playlists). These files have fixed schemas, typed values, and benefit from TOML's parse-time type enforcement and clean Git diffs. YAML is used for mission and campaign files, which are document-like: arbitrary nesting depth, large object lists, and YAML anchors/aliases let shared definitions be referenced multiple times without repetition. The rule of thumb is: does this look like a settings file (TOML) or a scenario/narrative document (YAML)?

## Game Screen State Machine

The game binary (`fighters-legacy`) uses a `ScreenManager` that owns all menu and in-game screens, drives transitions between them, and fires side effects (mouse capture, server pause) on each transition.

### `Screen` enum

```
MainMenu → Loading → Flight → Pause → (Flight or MainMenu)
                 ↘ MissionSelect → MissionBrief → Loading
MainMenu → Settings → MainMenu (or Pause)
Flight → Debrief → MainMenu
```

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `MainMenu` | Main menu; no local server running |
| `Loading` | Local server starting + ENet connecting; Quake-style progress messages |
| `MissionSelect` | Scrollable list of missions from content packs |
| `MissionBrief` | Mission name, map placeholder, "Fly" / "Back" |
| `Settings` | Graphics and audio settings; saves on Back |
| `Flight` | In-flight; mouse captured; flight HUD + windshield rain rendered |
| `Pause` | Semi-transparent overlay; sim tick paused (server-side) |
| `Debrief` | Post-flight summary stub |
| `Quit` | Sentinel returned by screens to request application exit |

### `IScreen` interface

Every screen implements `IScreen`:
- `update(IInput&, IWindow&) → Screen` — called once per frame; returns the desired next screen (or the same screen to stay put)
- `buildElements() → span<HudElement>` — returns overlay elements to submit via `IRenderer::submitOverlayElements`

### `ScreenManager`

`ScreenManager` owns all `IScreen` instances as `unique_ptr`s. `LoadingScreen` and `FlightScreen` are re-created per session via `reinitLoading()` / `reinitFlight()` so callbacks capture fresh session objects.

`transition(Screen next)` fires two side effects in addition to updating the current screen:
- **Mouse capture**: `setMouseCapture(true)` entering Flight; `setMouseCapture(false)` entering any menu
- **Server pause** (single-player only; null in multiplayer): `serverCmd("pause")` entering Pause; `serverCmd("resume")` leaving Pause

### Session lifecycle

| Phase | Server | ENet client |
|---|---|---|
| Main menu | Not running | Not connected |
| "Fly" selected → Loading | Starts in background thread | Connecting to 127.0.0.1:4778 |
| Flight / Pause / Debrief | Running | Connected |
| "Quit to Menu" | Stopped | Disconnected |

`Game::startGame()` launches the server thread and creates session objects. `Game::stopGame()` joins the thread, disconnects ENet, resets `SimRenderBridge`, and clears session state. Between sessions the main menu is shown with no server overhead.

### Client-Side Prediction

`ClientPrediction` (`game/fighters-legacy/`) reduces perceived input lag by running a local
`FlightIntegrator` that mirrors the server's physics for the player's own entity only:

- **History ring**: a 128-slot plain-C-array ring of `{seqNum, BufferedInput}` entries. On
  each `MsgClientInput` sent, the input is pushed into the ring and the local integrator is
  stepped one tick (steady wind from `EnvironmentState`; turbulence is excluded — it is
  stochastic server-side and cannot be replicated without a future seed-broadcast).

- **Reconciliation**: `ClientNetEventHandler::snapshotCallback` fires after each snapshot is
  assembled, before `publishExternal()`. The integrator is reset to the server's authoritative
  `FlightState` (reconstructed from the player's `EntityRenderEntry`, including the new `omega`
  body-frame angular-rate field), and the last `estimatedDelayTicks` history inputs are
  replayed forward. The replay depth is carried losslessly in the `SnapshotPeerDelayTicks` TLV
  (0x0102). The player's entry is then overwritten with the predicted state in-place; all other
  entities remain server-authoritative with velocity extrapolation unchanged.

- **Correction**: divergence > `snap_threshold_m` (default 5 m) → hard snap; smaller
  divergence → position blend at `blend_rate` per reconciliation. Both values are in
  `[prediction]` user.toml.

- **Non-Earth gravity**: if `MsgConnectAck::planetRadiusKm` differs from 6371 km by more
  than 1 km, a custom `CentralGravityField` is constructed and injected into the local
  integrator so prediction physics matches the server.

## World Terrain Architecture

The engine uses a single continuous **world terrain** rather than per-theater heightmap grids. Players can fly anywhere in the world in a single session; theater boundaries are mission conditions (triggering failure when crossed), not engine limits.

### World coordinate system

All entity positions, terrain queries, and camera origins use **double-precision (`glm::dvec3`)** world coordinates throughout the engine — `EntityTransform::pos`, `MsgEntityEntry::pos`, `EntityRenderEntry::position`, and `CameraView::worldOrigin` are all `double`/`dvec3`. The coordinate space is right-handed Y-up, in meters, matching glTF. Camera-relative rendering subtracts `worldOrigin` before GPU upload and casts the small relative offset to `vec3` — float32-safe at any scale including planet-scale distances. The flight integrator's body-frame velocity (`FlightState::vel_body[3]`) is also `double`, enabling ICBM-range trajectory precision without accumulation error; `MsgEntityEntry::vel float[3]` and `EntityRenderEntry::velocity glm::vec3` remain `float` — dead-reckoning over a single frame (~16 ms) requires no more than float precision.

### Spherical-Earth world model

Spherical-Earth physics and terrain curvature is the engine's only supported mode. There is no flat-Earth fallback. The planet radius defaults to 6 371 000 m (Earth); non-Earth servers set `[world] planet_radius_m` in `server.toml`.

**Coordinate convention:** the world origin (`{0, 0, 0}`) is lat=0°, lon=0°, alt=0 m (mean sea level). The planet centre sits at `{0, -R, 0}` in world space, where R = `planet_radius_m`.

**Control-source seam (`IEntityController`):** `IEntityController::sample(EntityState, tick, dt, SpatialIndex* si = nullptr) → ControlInput` decouples the flight integrator from any assumption about who (or what) is flying. `WorldBroadcaster` maintains an `EntityId`-keyed registry of `ControlledEntity{sim, controller}` structs and steps every one uniformly each tick: `controller->sample()` produces inputs, `FlightIntegrator::step()` advances physics, and the result serialises into `MsgWorldSnapshot` automatically. Three concrete driver types all implement the same interface: `PeerController` (drains one input per tick from the peer's `JitterBuffer` — `engine/net/JitterBuffer.h` — and stale-repeats the last drained input when the buffer is empty, preventing coasting under packet loss; buffer depth is seeded from `estimatedDelayTicks` on first input and then adaptively resized each tick via an EWMA of delay and inter-arrival jitter (`depth = ceil(ewma_delay + k × jitter)`, capped by `[world].jitter_buffer_depth`)), C++ autopilot controllers in `engine-ai`, and `LuaController` in `engine-script` (a sandboxed Lua 5.5 script that exposes entity state, `guidance.*` math, and spatial queries). Register a server-side controller via `WorldBroadcaster::registerController(id, controller, model)` after spawning an entity.

**`engine/ai/` — server-side autopilot controllers (`engine-ai` library):** Twelve concrete `IEntityController` implementations ship with the engine:

| Controller | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `LoiterController` | Orbits a fixed center point at configurable radius, altitude, and direction (`LoiterDir::Clockwise` / `CounterClockwise`). |
| `WaypointController` | Flies a sequence of 3D waypoints in order; advances on 3D capture radius; optional loop. |
| `PursuitController` | Pure-pursuit intercept: steers toward a target entity's current position each tick. |
| `EvadeController` | Horizontal escape: inverts the pursuit heading error to bank away from a threat entity. |
| `BreakTurnController` | Two-phase defensive ACM: Roll phase (bank toward the threat bearing for a configurable duration) followed by Pull phase (maximum-G elevator with afterburner, open-ended). |
| `LeadPursuitController` | Proportional navigation intercept: aims at a predicted intercept point (`target.pos + target.vel × TTC × navGain`); `navGain=0` degenerates to pure pursuit. |
| `LagPursuitController` | Lag pursuit intercept: aims behind the target (`target.pos − target.vel × TTC × lagFraction`); keeps the attacker inside the target's turn circle without overshooting; `lagFraction=0` = pure pursuit. |
| `ImmelmannController` | Half-loop + roll to reverse heading: Pull phase (full elevator + afterburner), Roll phase, Done. |
| `SplitSController` | Roll inverted + pull through to reverse heading: Roll phase (speedbrake to limit entry airspeed), Pull phase, Done. |
| `HighYoYoController` | Overshoot correction: banks away from target and climbs to bleed speed, then reacquires. Three phases: Climb, Reacquire, Done. |
| `LowYoYoController` | Dive-and-cut-corner to close range on a turning target. Three phases: Dive, Pull, Done. |
| `StateMachineController` | Composition framework: sequences child controllers with priority-ordered `Condition`-gated transitions and `minDwellSeconds` hysteresis. Built-in conditions: `ThreatWithinRange`, `ThreatBeyondRange`, `HpBelow`, `AnyEntityWithinRange`, `Always`, plus `And`/`Or`/`Not` combinators. |

`Guidance.h` (header-only) provides the shared math: `bodyForward`, `horizontalHeadingError`, `pitchErrorFromAlt`, `bankToTurnAileron`, `coordinatedRudder`, `elevatorFromPitchError`. `AiControllerFactory.h` (header-only) exposes `createController(behavior, args, entityManager*)` for string-based instantiation from admin commands. See `docs/sandbox.md` (AI behaviors table) for the full `--ai` argument reference; `--ai lua <script_name>` loads a Lua controller from a content pack's `ai/` directory.

**Lua AI (`engine-script` library):** `LuaController` wraps `LuaSandbox` and implements `IEntityController`. The script defines `function compute_control(state, tick, dt) → table`; the engine calls it every tick and maps the returned table fields to `ControlInput`. Pre-registered globals: `guidance.*` (six wrappers over `Guidance.h` math), `nearby_entities(cx, cz, radius_m)` (SpatialIndex range query), `get_entity(idx)` (full entity state lookup). Script state persists between ticks via module-level variables. See `docs/modding/ai.md` for the full API reference.

**Spatial partition (`engine-spatial` library):** `SpatialIndex` — 2D uniform spatial hash (XZ-plane bucketing, double-precision, configurable cell size, default 10 km). Rebuilt from all live entity positions once per sim tick at the start of `WorldBroadcaster::onTick()`. `queryRadius(center, radius, fn)` visits all candidate entities in O(cells × local density). `WorldBroadcaster::spatialIndex() const noexcept` exposes the current index for interest management (#346, implemented) and AoE warhead consumers (#356); `IEntityController::sample()` receives it as the optional `si` parameter so AI controllers (#353) can query neighbors inline without an extra pass. Thread model: rebuilt on the sim thread at the start of `onTick`; thereafter read **concurrently** by the data-parallel AI pass (`queryRadius` is `const` and read-only — see `engine-job` below). **Note:** the index is 2D (XZ plane); 3D distance culling for extreme-altitude engagements is tracked in a follow-on issue.

**Data-parallel sim tick (`engine-job` library):** `JobSystem` — a persistent worker pool (pure stdlib, `namespace fl`) with a blocking `parallel_for(count, grain, fn)` that splits a range into dynamically-claimed chunks across the workers + the calling thread. `WorldBroadcaster::onTick` runs the per-entity work as two parallel passes over the live controlled entities — an **AI pass** (`controller->sample()`, read-only on a consistent pre-step world snapshot) and an **integrate pass** (`stepFlightSim`, each worker writing only its own entity's state) — dispatched through the injected `JobSystem`, or inline when none is injected (unit tests, single-player). The path is **serial-equivalent by construction** (no cross-entity writes in the parallel region; per-entity deterministic turbulence RNG; no parallel float reduction), so results are bit-identical across worker counts and validated race-free under ThreadSanitizer. Sized by `[world] sim_worker_threads` (0 = auto, 1 = serial). This is Epic A (#494); the design rationale (data-parallel vs spatial sharding) and the #512 follow-on are in [docs/server-job-system-design.md](server-job-system-design.md).

**Graceful overrun governor (`engine/net/TickGovernor`, #514):** parallelism raises the sim ceiling but does not make it infinite — when the tick's measured wall-time still exceeds its fixed-step budget under load, the server must shed work rather than spiral. `WorldBroadcaster` owns one pure-AIMD `TickGovernor` (no glm/entity deps, unit-tested like `CongestionController`), steps it each `onTick` from the prior tick's `TickProfiler::lastTotalMs()`, and folds a single `loadFactor ∈ [floor, 1]` into three composing levers on top of the per-client congestion response: server-wide **snapshot send-rate decimation** (`max(perPeer, governor)`), **per-client byte-budget scaling**, and **AI-sample decimation** for non-player entities (`(tick+idx)%stride`, a pure function with per-entity input caching — serial-equivalent and TSan-clean). The control signal is an EWMA of per-tick wall-ms, not the laggy 60 s p99. The **integrate pass is never decimated** (fixed-`dt` stability), and auto-reducing the sim Hz is deliberately rejected (it would desync the 60 Hz-hardcoded prediction/jitter/congestion math) — the `GameLoop` catch-up cap (`[world] max_catchup_ticks`, exposed via `totalDroppedTicks()`) absorbs a fully integrate-bound server as bounded time dilation. A healthy/disabled/never-overrun server holds `loadFactor == 1` (no behaviour change, no wire change). Surfaced via `status`/`tickstats` + `--metrics-json` (`ServerTickReport` schema v2: `load_factor`/`dropped_ticks`); see [docs/server-job-system-design.md](server-job-system-design.md).

**Server tick-budget instrumentation (`engine-perf`, header-only):** `TickProfiler` measures the per-phase wall-time of each `WorldBroadcaster::onTick()` — `maintenance` (rate-limit prune, idle timeout, admin drains, spatial-index rebuild, input drain, jitter resize), `integrate` (`stepFlightSim` per entity), `ai` (controller `sample()` per entity), `collision` (`EntityManager::onTick`), `serialize` (telemetry + per-peer snapshot assembly/send + weather + shutdown), and `total` — keeping a rolling ring of the last ~60 s and computing min/mean/p95/p99/max plus an actual ring-derived tick-Hz on demand. `WorldBroadcaster::getTickBudget()` returns a mutex-guarded snapshot (safe from any thread). `fl-server` surfaces it three ways: the `status` and `tickstats` admin commands, and an atomic `--metrics-json` / `[metrics] tick_json_path` file export serialised through `ServerTickReport` (the same shape `bot_swarm` embeds as its `server_tick` block). This is the measurement foundation Epic A's job system optimises against and Epic G's Prometheus exporter (#546) reuses. The percentile math (`fl::Stats`/`computeStats`) lives in `engine/perf/Stats.h`, shared with the load-test tools via `tools/common/NetStats.h` (#513).

**World systems foundation (`engine-world` library):** pure value types shared by the (deferred) world-systems work — no behaviour yet. `AlertLevel` (`Peacetime`/`Elevated`/`Conflict`/`WarState`) and `EscalationStage` (`Clean`→`Hostile`) enums; `FactionDef` (id, name, starting alert level) and `FactionRegistry` — an O(1)-by-`uint16_t`-index faction store (`indexOf`/`get`/`count`, a symmetric `relationship` graph defaulting to `Neutral` off-diagonal / `Friendly` on the diagonal, and per-faction `alertLevel`); and the `AirspaceZone` descriptor (circle or convex-polygon XZ region with an altitude band, owner faction, and policy id). `EntityState` carries a `uint16_t factionIndex` (0 = neutral) that indexes the registry. `FactionRegistry` threading is three-tier: `m_defs`/`m_index` are immutable after `load()` (lock-free reads); the relationship matrix is sim-thread-only; only the per-faction alert levels are mutex-guarded, because `setAlertLevel()` may be called from the network/main thread. The consuming logic — `AlertSystem` (#162) and `IWorldAiProvider` (#163) — is deferred; this issue (#415) lands only the foundation so those can build without churn.

**Algorithm choice — uniform grid vs. tree-based index:** a tree-based index (quad-tree, k-d tree) adapts to non-uniform entity distributions but has O(N log N) rebuild cost and wins on range queries only when N > ~10,000 entities in highly clustered configurations. A combat flight sim distributes entities uniformly across large areas by the nature of flight dynamics; the "hot dogfight" case where many aircraft cluster in one 10 km cell simultaneously requires serializing all of them to nearby peers anyway, so no query work is saved by a better algorithm. The uniform grid handles Phase 4 targets (~628 entities) and Phase 8 stretch goals (~5,000 AI drones) comfortably.

**No `ISpatialIndex` interface:** `queryRadius` is a function template (`Fn&&`). Virtualizing it requires erasing `Fn` to `std::function`, adding allocator overhead and an indirect call on every per-entity callback at 60 Hz — pure cost at this entity scale. Algorithm is an implementation detail behind a stable concrete API (`clear`, `insert`, `queryRadius`); swapping to a different algorithm later means replacing `SpatialIndex.cpp` only, with no consumer changes — the same flexibility an interface would provide, at zero runtime cost.

**Gravity (`IGravityField` seam):** `CentralGravityField` (`engine/flight/CentralGravityField.h`) implements 1/r² falloff toward the planet centre; `earthInstance()` provides an Earth singleton (R = 6 371 000 m). The default for every `FlightIntegrator` and `WorldBroadcaster`. Swap via `FlightIntegrator::setGravityField()` or `WorldBroadcaster::setGravityField(field, planetRadiusKm)` for non-Earth planets. `WorldBroadcaster` records the radius for transmission to clients in `MsgConnectAck.planetRadiusKm`.

**Atmosphere altitude (`IGravityField::geodeticAltitude()`):** `FlightIntegrator` uses `m_gravity->geodeticAltitude(pos)` instead of `pos[1]` for ISA pressure-altitude lookup, so the correct atmosphere density is applied even when the entity is far from the Z-axis (where world-Y diverges from geodetic altitude).

**Geodetic utilities (`engine/flight/Geodetic.h`):** header-only inline functions — `worldToGeodetic(x,y,z)→LatLonAlt`, `geodeticToWorld(lla,x,y,z)`, `geodeticAltitude(x,y,z)` — convert between world XYZ and spherical lat/lon/alt. All angles in radians; `kEarthRadiusM = 6 371 000.0`.

**Terrain curvature (`TerrainStreamer::setPlanetRadius(double)`):** per-vertex spherical Y correction `sqrt(R²−vx²−vz²)−R` is baked into each vertex by `buildTerrainMeshGlb()` (via the `chunkWorldX`, `chunkWorldZ`, and `planetRadius` parameters); surface normals account for the curvature gradient too. `heightAt()` applies the same correction independently from the raw heightmap (thread-safe via `shared_mutex`). `getRenderItems()` places each chunk at Y = 0 in world space — all curvature is encoded in vertex data, so tiles visibly curve rather than lying flat. Default radius is 6 371 000 m (Earth). Must call `setPlanetRadius()` before the first `update()`; changing it after chunks are loaded leaves stale meshes.

**Client wiring:** `ClientNetEventHandler` reads `planetRadiusKm` from `MsgConnectAck` and exposes it via `planetRadiusKm()`. `Game` wires it to `terrainStreamer.setPlanetRadius()` on `Screen::Flight` entry.

### Chunk format

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Chunk size | 15,360 m (512 intervals × 30 m) |
| Resolution | 513×513 pixels, 16-bit grayscale PNG |
| DEM source | Copernicus GLO-30 (ESA, 30 m global, free) — no upsampling required |
| LOD 0 | 513×513 px, 30 m/px, streamed within ~46 km (3×3 chunks) |
| LOD 1 | 257×257 px, 60 m/px, streamed within ~77 km (5×5 chunks) |
| LOD 2 | 129×129 px, 120 m/px, streamed within ~107 km (7×7 chunks) |
| Eviction | Beyond ~120 km; max ~83 chunks in memory at steady state |

### Terrain ID and overrides

`"world"` is the canonical terrain ID. fl-base-pack provides global coverage at base priority. Theater content packs override individual chunks at higher mod priority via `IContentPack::resolveTerrainChunk(terrainId, chunkX, chunkY, lod)` — the engine walks the content stack and uses the first pack that resolves a given chunk.

### Theaters

Theaters are geographic bounding boxes in world coordinates defined by `theaters/<id>.toml` in a content pack. They are mission-layer concepts: the engine does not partition terrain by theater, and terrain streaming is always camera-driven across the full world grid.

## Repository Naming Convention

All first-party repositories and binaries in the fighters-legacy ecosystem use the `fl-` prefix. Content pack plugins for specific external games use a `<game>-content` pattern. Core repositories keep their full names.

| Pattern | Examples |
|---|---|
| `fl-<name>` | `fl-server` (dedicated server), `fl-lobby` (matchmaking service), `fl-base-pack` (bundled default content) |
| `<game>-content` | `fa-content` (Jane's Fighters Anthology content plugin) |
| Full name | `fighters-legacy` (engine + game), `fighters-codex` (reference repo) |

---

## Key Design Constraints

- **Cross-platform from day one.** All code compiles on MSVC (Windows), GCC/Clang (Linux), and AppleClang (macOS). Platform-specific paths are confined to `platform/`.
- **`IContentPack` is the only content boundary.** Adding a new content source means implementing this interface, not modifying the engine.
- **C++20, no extensions.** `CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF` is enforced across all presets.
