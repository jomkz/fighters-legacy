# Architecture Overview

fighters-legacy is a general-purpose combat flight sim engine. The engine is fully **content-agnostic** — it has no knowledge of any specific game, franchise, or asset format. All game content enters the engine through a single boundary: the `IContentPack` interface.

### Platform HAL (`platform/`)

Thin abstraction over OS and hardware APIs. Each backend is isolated:

| Module | Backend | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer | Vulkan 1.3 + MoltenVK | `platform/vulkan/` |
| Windowing / Input | SDL3 | `platform/sdl3/` |
| Audio | OpenAL Soft | `platform/openal/` |
| Networking | ENet | `platform/net/` |

The HAL exposes platform-independent interfaces to the engine core. Nothing above the HAL layer links directly against Vulkan, SDL3, OpenAL, or ENet headers.

#### Platform HAL Interfaces

All interfaces live under `platform/` and are exposed via the `platform-hal` CMake INTERFACE library. Engine core and backends link against `platform-hal` rather than including headers by path.

| Interface | Header | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IWindowEventHandler` | `platform/IWindowEventHandler.h` | Callback target for window events (resize, close); implemented by the engine game loop |
| `IWindow` | `platform/IWindow.h` | Create/destroy OS window, pump events, query dimensions, expose native handle for surface creation |
| `IRenderer` | `platform/IRenderer.h` | Render frame lifecycle: init, beginFrame, endFrame, shutdown |
| `IAudio` | `platform/IAudio.h` | Buffer upload, source play/stop/position/velocity, listener transform |
| `IInput` | `platform/IInput.h` | Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad state (SDL3 GameController API) |
| `INetworkEventHandler` | `platform/INetwork.h` | Callback target for network events (connect, disconnect, receive); implemented by the multiplayer subsystem |
| `INetwork` | `platform/INetwork.h` | UDP transport: bind/connect, send/recv, peer state, frame pump |
| `IFilesystem` | `platform/IFilesystem.h` | Synchronous file I/O and directory scan over two path domains (Assets, UserData) |
| `ILogger` | `platform/ILogger.h` | Structured logging routed to the platform-native output |

**Event handler pattern:** `IWindowEventHandler` and `INetworkEventHandler` are separate interfaces registered with their respective `IWindow` / `INetwork` instances. The engine implements the handler; the platform backend calls it during `pollEvents()` / `service()`. This keeps platform-to-engine callbacks decoupled without requiring the backend to know anything about the game loop.

**Design rules for all HAL interfaces:**
- No platform-specific headers (`SDL3`, `vulkan.h`, `al.h`, `enet.h`) may appear in any interface file.
- `IWindow::nativeHandle()` returns `void*` — the only platform type that crosses the boundary, and it does so as an opaque pointer used only by the Vulkan backend internally.
- All interface methods are pure virtual. No implementation code lives in these headers.

**`IRenderer` scope (Phase 1):** `IRenderer` is lifecycle-only — init, frame begin/end, shutdown. Scene submission (mesh handles, transforms, materials) and a render graph abstraction are added in the Vulkan backend workstream (Phase 2).

**`IFilesystem` is synchronous:** `readFile` blocks until the OS delivers the data. It is correct for startup asset loading, mod discovery, and config reads. It must not be called on the main thread for per-frame terrain streaming. Async file I/O is a separate Phase 2 design item.

### Engine Core (`engine/`)

Game logic and simulation, independent of any specific content:

- **Game loop** — fixed-timestep update, variable-rate render
- **Entity system** — component-based scene graph
- **Flight model** — aerodynamics simulation
- **AI runtime** — Lua-scripted AI behaviours
- **Mission loader** — scenario and campaign structure

### Content System (`engine/content/`)

Bridges the engine core to external content:

- **`IContentPack`** — the single interface all content packs must implement. Exposes asset loading, mission data, and configuration. The engine calls only this interface; it never knows what implements it.
- **`AssetManager`** — caches and serves assets requested by the engine core via active content packs.
- **`ModLoader`** — discovers and loads `IContentPack` implementors at runtime (shared libraries).

### Content Packs (external)

Any repository that implements `IContentPack` and compiles to a shared library can be loaded as a content pack. The engine is indifferent to the source or format of the underlying assets.

## Locked Architectural Decisions

These decisions are finalized and not subject to revision without an RFC.

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Rendering | Vulkan + MoltenVK | One API everywhere; MoltenVK → Metal on Apple Silicon |
| Windowing / input | SDL3 | Wayland + modern controller support; long-term path |
| Audio | OpenAL Soft | Positional 3D audio; native music in OGG; no MIDI dependency in engine core |
| Network transport | ENet (reliable UDP) | Reliable + unreliable channels; congestion control; cross-platform |
| Build system | CMake 3.25+ | Cross-platform from day one |
| Engine repo | `fighters-legacy` (this repo) | Separate from fighters-toolkit |
| ft-gui future | Port to SDL3 + Vulkan | After engine HAL is stable (Phase 4) |
| Content system | Plugin / content-pack architecture | Each content source = one plugin; mods = other plugins; engine core has zero content dependency |
| Native 3D models | glTF 2.0 | Royalty-free; Blender export; industry standard |
| Native textures | PNG (source) + KTX2/DDS (GPU) | Mipmaps, BC compression; toolchain converts PNG → KTX2 at pack time |
| Native audio | OGG Vorbis / Opus | Open, compressed, widely supported |
| Native flight model | TOML | Human-readable, structured, easily diffable |
| Native missions | YAML | Human-readable, tool-friendly |
| Native campaigns | YAML | Arbitrary theater graph; no FA 6-theater limit |
| Native terrain | Streaming heightmap chunks + JSON | No tile-count cap; supports large theaters |
| Native AI scripts | Lua 5.4 | Embeddable, sandbox-able, moddable |
| Multiplayer topology | `fl-server` dedicated binary + `fl-lobby` REST service | Server-authoritative; no P2P player-count cap; self-hostable |
| Entity system | Dynamic pool, no hard caps | No fixed object count limit |
| License | GPL v3 | Engine modifications must stay open source; protects community investment |
| Hosting | GitHub, public repository | Unlimited Actions CI on public repos; GitHub Free sufficient |

## Content Pack Architecture

This is the central design decision that affects every other phase. **The engine core has no dependency on any content library.** All asset access goes through an `IContentPack` interface.

### Mods vs Plugins

Content for Fighters Legacy comes in two forms.

**Mods (Lua + assets)** are directories dropped into `mods/<name>/` containing a `manifest.toml` plus any combination of Lua AI scripts, glTF meshes, TOML flight model and weapon data, YAML missions and campaigns, OGG audio, and PNG / KTX2 textures. **Most user content — reskins, missions, new aircraft, custom campaigns — is a mod.** No C++ compiler required.

**Plugins (compiled content packs)** are shared libraries (`.dll` / `.so` / `.dylib`) that implement the `IContentPack` interface. GPL v3 applies to compiled plugins unless a linking exception is granted. **Install compiled plugins only from authors whose source you can verify.**

### IContentPack Interface

```
engine/content/IContentPack.h
    name(), version(), priority()
    init()              → Status { Ready | NeedsConfiguration }
    configure(IWindow*) → bool
    hasAsset(name, AssetType) → bool
    loadMesh(name)        → MeshData
    loadTexture(name)     → TextureData
    loadAudio(name)       → AudioBuffer
    loadFlightModel(name) → FlightModel
    loadMission(name)     → MissionData
    loadTerrain(name)     → TerrainData
    loadAIScript(name)    → AIScript
    listAssets(AssetType) → vector<string>
```

### Mod Loader

```
engine/content/ModLoader.cpp
    scanModsDirectory("mods/")
    loadManifest("mods/<name>/manifest.toml")
    buildContentStack()   — sorted by priority; higher-priority packs override lower
    resolveAsset(name, type) — walk stack until found
```

### Mod Manifest Format (TOML)

```toml
[mod]
name        = "Example Content Pack"
id          = "example-content"
version     = "1.0.0"
engine-api  = "1.0"
priority    = 100
depends     = []
```

### Content Pack Layout on Disk

```
mods/
    example-content/          ← compiled content pack (ships as shared library)
        manifest.toml
        example-content.dll/.so
    free-base-pack/           ← community open-content (Phase 6+)
        manifest.toml
        aircraft/
        missions/
        terrain/
        audio/
    my-reskin-mod/            ← user mod example
        manifest.toml
        aircraft/f22/
            F22.png
```

## Key Design Constraints

- **Cross-platform from day one.** All code compiles on MSVC (Windows), GCC/Clang (Linux), and AppleClang (macOS). Platform-specific paths are confined to `platform/`.
- **`IContentPack` is the only content boundary.** Adding a new content source means implementing this interface, not modifying the engine.
- **C++20, no extensions.** `CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF` is enforced across all presets.
