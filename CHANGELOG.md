## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **renderer,game**: The builtin placeholder entity is now a directional wedge (~10 m, +X forward) with a flat bottom on the ground, a flat vertical back, and a single nose vertex pointing in the direction of travel — so its orientation is unambiguous (the old symmetric tetrahedron gave no sense of facing). Each face is rendered a distinct debug colour (bottom=red, back=green, right=blue, left=yellow) via a new `kRenderFlagDebugFaceColor` flag + the forward shader's `shadingMode` path, making rotation/heading obvious at a glance.
- **renderer**: Elevation/slope terrain shading. The forward pass now derives terrain albedo from absolute elevation (grassy lowlands → earthy mid → rocky highs) and surface slope (steep faces blend toward bare rock), giving the previously flat-shaded single-colour terrain visible relief and depth cues. Applied only to terrain via a new `kRenderFlagTerrain` render flag + `ForwardPushConstants::terrainShading` (other meshes are unaffected).
- **renderer**: Live camera + entity readouts in the F3 performance overlay (`PerformanceOverlay::setSceneInfo`): camera mode, eye position, look pitch, and height-above-ground, plus the player entity position, its AGL, and the pitch/distance from the camera to the entity. Replaces the always-on red `CAM` debug text formerly drawn by `GameConsole::buildHud` (the `toggle_pos` console widget still shows the entity position on demand).
- **tools,docs**: `gen_builtin_glb.py --export-dir <dir>` writes the built-in placeholder meshes (`builtin_entity.glb`, `builtin_floor.glb`) as real glTF files for inspection in Blender. New "Coordinate system and winding" section in `docs/modding/3d-models.md` documents the engine's mesh convention (+Y up, +X forward, CCW-from-outside / outward normals, single-sided opaque materials) and how to verify it with Blender's Face Orientation overlay.
- **network**: Configurable peer spawn points in `server.toml` via `[[spawn.points]]` (each with `x` and `z` fields in world-space metres) and `agl_offset` (default 500 m). Terrain elevation is cached at startup per point from `TerrainStreamer::heightAt()`; peers are assigned round-robin. Omitting the section retains legacy behaviour (origin spawn). Closes #369.
- **network**: Server-side `seqNum` staleness guard in `WorldBroadcaster::onReceive`: out-of-order and duplicate `MsgClientInput` packets are silently discarded (#348)
- **network**: Per-peer one-way delay estimation via `MsgClientInput::tickIndex`; displayed in the `peers` admin command output as delay in ticks and approximate milliseconds (#348)
- **network**: Admin command channel streams long responses as `MsgAdminResponseChunk` (0x0A) packets, removing the previous 125-character truncation limit for commands like `help` and `peers` (#239)
- **network**: Added `reqId` field to `MsgAdminCommand` and `MsgAdminResponse`; server echoes it in all response packets for request/response correlation (#361)
- **renderer**: AA mode selector (Off / FXAA / MSAA 2x–8x stub) in Settings screen, replacing the on/off AA toggle; MSAA modes fall back to FXAA with a warning until GPU implementation lands (#235)
- **renderer**: Shadow quality setting (Off / Low / Medium / High / Ultra) in Settings screen; runtime shadow atlas resize with configurable cascade count (0–4) (#235)
- **renderer**: Particle density setting (Low / Medium / High / Ultra) in Settings screen; runtime SSBO resize (512–16384 particle slots) (#235)

### Changed

- **flight**: `FlightState::pos_world` upgraded from `float[3]` to `double[3]`, eliminating silent precision loss at large world-space distances. `IGravityField::accelWorld` and `geodeticAltitude` parameter types upgraded to `const double[]`; `geodeticAltitude` return type changed to `double`. `WorldBroadcaster::setGroundElevationQuery` callback signature changed to `std::function<float(double, double)>`; `cachedEntityX/Z()` return type changed to `double`. Closes #371.
- **renderer**: `buildTerrainMeshGlb` now accepts optional `chunkWorldX`, `chunkWorldZ`, `planetRadius` parameters; when `planetRadius > 0` each vertex gets the correct per-vertex spherical Y correction (`sqrt(R²−vx²−vz²)−R`) baked in, replacing the previous single per-chunk corner offset applied in `TerrainStreamer::getRenderItems()`. Surface normals account for the curvature gradient too. Closes #370.
- **engine**: Spherical-Earth physics and terrain curvature is now the engine's only supported mode. The `[world] spherical_earth` config flag and all flat-Earth fallback paths have been removed. `planet_radius_m` (default 6 371 000 m) remains configurable for non-Earth planets. Per-entity terrain height queries replace the global scalar floor, so each entity uses the correct terrain elevation at its XZ position.
- **network**: `MsgClientInput` delivery moves from reliable channel 0 to unreliable channel 1; eliminates retransmission-induced input lag (#348)

### Fixed

- **renderer,tools**: Fixed the opaque/shadow pipeline rendering standard glTF meshes inside-out. The pipeline combined `frontFace=VK_FRONT_FACE_CLOCKWISE` with the projection's Y-flip (`proj[1][1] = -f`); those two flips compound, so standard CCW-from-outside glTF (what Blender exports, what `docs/modding/3d-models.md` documents) had its front faces culled and back faces shown (see-through gaps). The terrain and builtin meshes had been authored *backwards* to compensate, which masked it until the colored directional wedge exposed it. The opaque, transparent, and shadow pipelines now use `VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, and `buildTerrainMeshGlb` + the builtin wedge/floor are authored to the standard CCW convention — so Blender/glTF exports render correctly without flipping. `validate-mesh` now detects inside-out meshes (triangle winding opposite the vertex normals) and reports them with a Blender "Recalculate Outside" hint; `test_scene_renderer` and `test_validate_mesh` guard the convention. The builtin reference meshes also gained proper node names so they pass `validate-mesh` with zero warnings/errors (they're the documented modding reference), and CI validates them on every build.
- **renderer**: Fixed a double camera-relative rebase that placed all mesh and terrain geometry at `worldPos − 2·worldOrigin` instead of `worldPos − worldOrigin`. `SceneRenderer`/`TerrainStreamer` already rebase world positions against the camera origin (in double precision) before upload, but `mesh.vert` subtracted `worldOrigin` a second time. With the sandbox spawn at ~575 m elevation this pushed the entire visible world ~575 m below the camera, so the camera appeared to float far above the ground and the aircraft rendered tiny and unreachable (rendered size scaled with distance instead of inversely). The vertex shader no longer re-subtracts; the shadow cascades are now built in camera-relative space (`VkRenderer::computeCascades` no longer adds `worldOrigin`) and `mesh.frag` samples shadows in that same space, keeping the shadow and forward passes consistent.
- **game**: Free-fly camera movement (WASD/QE) is now frame-rate independent (metres per second scaled by frame time) instead of per-frame, fixing movement being ~4x too fast at high frame rates; the default speed is 30 m/s, adjustable 2–1000 m/s with +/-.
- **renderer**: Fixed inverted winding on the builtin placeholder tetrahedron — its faces were wound so the generated normals pointed inward, which made the engine's opaque pipeline (frontFace=CW after the Vulkan Y-flip, cull BACK) render it inside-out. The aircraft was visible from every camera angle (including cockpit, where the camera sits at the entity centroid and back-face culling is supposed to hide the ownship) and was unlit/incorrect from outside. Faces are now wound CCW-from-outside (outward normals); a `test_scene_renderer` case guards against regression.
- **game**: Fixed the ~2 s all-blue-sky flash and downward camera "snap" (origin → terrain height) seen right after loading into flight. The dedicated server now pumps terrain streaming until each spawn-point's LOD0 chunk is `Ready` before computing spawn elevations (`TerrainStreamer::heightReadyAt()`), so entities spawn at the correct terrain height immediately instead of at y≈0 and being lifted by the per-tick ground-collision floor once terrain finishes streaming. The camera, which correctly follows the player entity, no longer starts underground.
- **game**: Cockpit view (F1) no longer draws the player's own aircraft (you sit at the entity origin). It is rendered shadow-only via `kRenderFlagShadowOnly` — omitted from the color pass but still submitted to the shadow pass — so the aircraft's shadow on the ground remains visible. `SceneRenderer::setHiddenEntity()` + VkRenderer honoring `kRenderFlagShadowOnly` in the forward/transparent passes; `test_scene_renderer` guards the behavior.
- **game**: Reworked the external cameras around a single free-fly camera (`CameraController` is now a thin pose holder — `setPose(eye, forward, up)` — and `CameraInput` computes the per-mode pose). None of the cameras orbit the entity anymore. Free (F4) is a true fly camera: WASD/QE move the eye anywhere and the mouse turns the view, clamped just above the terrain so it can descend to the ground but not pass through it. Chase (F2) is a fixed follow locked behind the tail, following the heading — the user cannot rotate it, so the aircraft never appears to spin. Cockpit (F1) stays locked inside the entity (ownship hidden).
- **renderer,game**: The builtin placeholder tetrahedron is now an aircraft-sized ~10 m (circumradius R=5, was an oversized R=20/≈40 m) authored with its origin at the ground-contact point (lowest vertices at y=0) instead of the centroid — the standard vehicle convention (origin at the gear line). The physics floor clamps the entity origin straight to the terrain so the mesh rests ON the ground with no per-mesh clearance hack (the previous server-side `kBuiltinEntityGroundClearanceM` lift is removed). Entity origin, terrain, and the free-camera ground floor now agree on "the ground". The chase and free cameras aim at the entity origin (so they no longer point above where it sits and require looking down), and the cockpit eye is raised to the body centre (`kEntityCentreHeightM`, a placeholder until meshes carry a cockpit-anchor / bounds).
- **flight**: Aircraft in ground contact are no longer blown around by weather. A parked entity used to slide downwind whenever the wind changed because the relative-airspeed model turns steady wind into aerodynamic drag; `FlightIntegrator::step` now suppresses steady-wind aero forcing and turbulence while the gear is carrying the aircraft, and adds a static parking-friction hold (engages only at low ground speed and near-idle throttle, so the takeoff roll is unaffected) that also zeroes angular velocity so a parked aircraft is fully static (no residual spin from settling or pre-contact gusts).
- **game**: Draw distance km values at startup (Low=20, Medium=50, High=100, Ultra=200) now match the values applied when the user saves from Settings screen
