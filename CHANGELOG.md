## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **game**: Wire haptic feedback for flight-sim events via `HapticController`; covers gun burst, hit taken, stall buffet, afterburner ignition/sustain, engine failure, G-LOC onset, transonic buffet, GPWS double-pulse, and gear touchdown; stub entry points provided for missile launch, missile warning, compressor stall, carrier trap, hydraulic failure, and ordnance release (#127)
- **audio**: Tracks in `shuffle = true` playlist states are now randomised on state entry using Fisher-Yates; the shuffled order is preserved for the full cycle and re-shuffled on each loop (closes #168)

### Fixed

- **audio**: Listener velocity is now wired from the player entity to OpenAL; Doppler pitch shift is audible when flying past positional audio sources at high speed (closes #167)
- **renderer**: Particle emitters with `spawnRate < 60/s` now produce correct output at 60 fps; fractional remainder is carried across frames instead of being truncated to zero each frame (closes #263)

### Changed

- **build**: `find_package` version floors for all system-preferred deps tightened to full three-component versions matching their pinned FetchContent tags; dependency version table in `docs/development.md` updated and completed (closes #280)
- **build**: SDL3 upgraded from 3.2.10 to 3.4.10
- **build**: Lua upgraded from 5.4.7 to 5.5.0; content-pack AI scripts must not use `global` as a variable name (reserved keyword in Lua 5.5)
- **ci**: Removed `liblua5.4-dev` / `brew install lua` from all CI workflows; Lua is now built from source via FetchContent on all platforms (`liblua5.5-dev` not yet in package managers)
- **renderer**: `rain` and `storm_rain` preset spawn rates reduced from 600/s and 1200/s to 100/s and 200/s respectively; the previous values compensated for the truncation bug and also exceeded `kMaxParticles=8192` at 9 emitters
