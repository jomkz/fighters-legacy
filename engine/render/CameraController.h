// different ways of driving the one camera:
//   Free    — the pose is driven directly by the user (WASD/QE move the eye, mouse turns the view),
//             clamped so it cannot pass through the ground.
//   Chase   — the pose is computed to sit behind the entity and follow it.
//   Cockpit — the pose is locked to the entity (eye at the entity, looking along its forward axis).
//
// mode() is a label read by the game layer (HUD, hiding the ownship in cockpit); it does not change
// how view() builds the camera — every mode resolves to the same setPose()/view() path.
//
// All state is main-thread-only. No input processing is done here.
