// Per-client priority/budget snapshot scheduler (#516). Pure ranking + budgeting policy, isolated
// from WorldBroadcaster the same way SnapshotCodec / JitterBuffer / AuthTracker are — no glm, no
// engine-entity deps, fully unit-testable in isolation.
//
// Each tick the broadcaster builds a SnapshotCandidate per entity visible to a peer (after the 3D
// interest cull), then calls selectSnapshotRecords() to choose the highest-relevance set that fits a
// per-client byte budget. Lower-priority entities are deferred to a later tick; a recency term
// (ticksSinceSent) guarantees no entity is starved indefinitely. The peer's own entity is always
// admitted first (client-side prediction reconciliation needs it every tick).
